- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xaviemmanuel
- 👀 I’m interested in Electrical Design Automation using AutoCAD and some type of information management platform such as Access Database.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Access, Visual Basic and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas and projects regarding automation design of drawings, calculations and diagrams for Electrical Design.
- 📫 How to reach me: through this platform. I'm new at programming but I'm constantly searching for ideas to minimize and optimize workload.
